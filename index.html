<h1>Mobile App Development</h1>
<p>Mobile application development is the process of creating software applications that run on a mobile device, and a typical mobile application utilizes a network connection to work with remote computing resources. Hence, the mobile development process involves creating installable software bundles (code, binaries, assets, etc.) , implementing backend services such as data access with an API, and testing the application on target devices.</p>

  <p>"It was a pleasure working with the entire BitCot development team. They were able to launch our iOS app in a few months and it looks and works beautifully. It's difficult to find a technical partner with a balance of business acumen but Raj provided us with technical and strategic insight. He has a wealth of knowledge in app development which was integral in the creation of such a reliable product. He met all our requirements and delivered on time and on budget. He's a good communicator, personable and flexible as demonstrated by his understanding of the needs of his clients. I would definitely recommend BitCot to my network and I look forward to working with him again in the future!"</p>

    "I have Known BitCot for 4 years and have been impressed with the diversity and quality of BitCotâ€™s work. With that solid foundation it was really easy to select BitCot as our development partner. BitCot has both the experience and collaborative approach to take ideas and create incredible cross-platform apps. We literally went from idea/mockups to taking revenue in 3 months. The speed and quality BitCot provided was essential in helping Stomp Sessions acquire customers, raise funds and establish partnerships. Their communication and use of collaboration tools has made development smooth. I would highly recommend BitCot to anyone building a cross platform mobile/web apps for startups or established businesses."
